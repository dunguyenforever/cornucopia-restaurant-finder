# Backend Code

## This will be a short document on the backend side of codem, further details will be added later. 

### Server side
> Stable-matching.cpp and Graph.cpp
- Code framework to match client/users/restaurants with each other in the most efficient way. Combined with queue and stack structures. We will get a fairly sustainable
  matching model for the backend. In addition, the basic nature of it is there to be modified later on so changes are expected. More simplification is expected in the future. 
> the packages json files
- Mainly to handle data, not sure if this is the most efficient way to communicate data with the server, need to see more in the future. 
- Furthermore, it is there to be utilized with the facebook cpp files as reference to design a smarter form of matching and time efficiency in the future.

#### The backend code is served to organize and operate the data and the matching. Currently, only the matching seems to be stable and moderately functional so will be
focusing on the data management side on later iterations.
